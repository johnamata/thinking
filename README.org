* WHAT IS THIS?
My repo as I do some tiny problems to develop some computational thinking. For now I'm focusing on the algorithmic side of computational thinking.  My Leetcode and codeforces solutions have explanations through comments directly on the source code. My kattis solutions are in another repo, [[https://github.com/johnamata/competitive-programming][here]]. But for now that repo is private, as it contains code from algorithm courses I'm going through such as 

So why spend time on tiny programming problems? Well I'm doing this because my todo list for january-march 2021 is to:

"Do a few basic "algorithmic" problems to drill computational thinking. Might prepare me for coding interviews that does their exam along the same vein"
